## Project Overview
This project is a Python-based application that enables users to create simple video slideshows by combining images and music. The goal of the project is to offer an intuitive and user-friendly interface that mimics key features found in video editing platforms, allowing users to easily organize images and background music into a cohesive video slideshow.

### Libraries Installation
**[Back To Top](#back-to-top)**
#### 1. Moviepy
Description: A powerful imaging library in Python, used for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. It's the modern fork of the original PIL (Python Imaging Library).

Installation: In the terminal, type "pip install pillow"

#### 2. Pillow
Description: A powerful imaging library in Python, used for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. It's the modern fork of the original PIL (Python Imaging Library).

Installation: In the terminal, type "pip install pillow"

#### 3. pydub
Description: A simple and easy-to-use library for manipulating audio files. It allows for tasks like slicing, concatenating, and exporting audio in various formats.

Installation: In the terminal, type "pip install pydub"

#### 4. tkinterdnd2
Description: An extension of Tkinter that adds drag-and-drop functionality, enabling users to drag files directly into the application window.

Installation: In the terminal, type "pip install tkinterdnd2"

#### 5. matplotlib
Description: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It's used here for visualizing audio waveforms.

Installation: In the terminal, type "pip install matplotlib"

#### 6. numpy
Description: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on them.

Installation: In the terminal, type "pip install numpy"

#### 7. ffmpeg
Description: While not a Python library, ffmpeg is essential for handling audio and video processing tasks in moviepy and pydub. It needs to be installed separately and should be accessible via your system's PATH.

Installation (Varies for different Operating Systems):

1) 

#### Verifying Installations
After installing, you can verify that all libraries are correctly installed by running the following Python script:
_import moviepy
import PIL
import pydub
import tkinterdnd2
import matplotlib
import numpy

print("All libraries are successfully installed!")_
If no errors are raised, your environment is set up correctly to run the Simple Video Editor UI application.
